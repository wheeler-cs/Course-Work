# CSC4200-Networks
 
 This repository is for code related to CSC 4200, an introductory course for computer networks. This
 course was taken as part of my undergraduate degree at Tennessee Technological University.

 ## Assignment
 [Socket Echoes](<Project 01 - Socket Programming>): A basic socket program where a client sends a
 string to the server, the server reads the data, and the string is echoed back to the client.

 [Network Packet](<Project 02 - Network Packets>): A project that builds upon the socket echo server
 by introducing the concept of packets with headers. Headers are packed as fixed-length binary data
 and passed between the server and client.
