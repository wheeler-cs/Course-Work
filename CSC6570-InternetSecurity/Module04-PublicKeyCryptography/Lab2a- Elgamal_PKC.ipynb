To do this, she will need to recompute the **shared key**, which is the result of raising $C_1$ to her **private key** modulo the **Global Prime**. Once the **shared key** is recomputed, she multiplies the **ciphertext** by the **shared key** raised to the **Global Prime** - 2. The math theory behind the Elgamal scheme is why this shared key can be recomputed without being shared for decryption.\n","\n","$ sharedKey = C_1^{X} $ mod $P$\n","\n","$ Plaintext = C_2 * sharedKey^{P - 2} $ mod $P$"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":15,"status":"ok","timestamp":1630686595832,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Ismail","photoUrl":"","userId":"08030624987779284067"},"user_tz":300},"id":"_bp0IQ95EyhK","outputId":"24b17f85-f5b9-438d-ec95-0f74d72b2766"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Encrypted Message Received (C1, C2): (91, 'ƎӤזށۥזށۥ؏ۥǕȎށށ؏ϲȎۥªӤ؏ªۥ\\u0380זããۥ܁ȎۥƜށȎĜۥ؏ށۥ؏ˇۥȎѲ؏ǕҫãȎۥªιۥĜȎǕιˇށªڏ؏ªȎۥªӤȎۥ˲ãϲ؏Ǖ؏ãۥ֏Ɯ܁ãז*ۥÕȎդۥ˲ˇ*ڏդҫªזιˇҏ')\n","\n","Recomputed Shared Key: 242\n","\n","Ciphertext: ƎӤזށۥזށۥ؏ۥǕȎށށ؏ϲȎۥªӤ؏ªۥ΀זããۥ܁ȎۥƜށȎĜۥ؏ށۥ؏ˇۥȎѲ؏ǕҫãȎۥªιۥĜȎǕιˇށªڏ؏ªȎۥªӤȎۥ˲ãϲ؏Ǖ؏ãۥ֏Ɯ܁ãז*ۥÕȎդۥ˲ˇ*ڏդҫªזιˇҏ\n","Ciphertext (Decimal): [398, 1252, 1494, 1921, 1765, 1494, 1921, 1765, 1551, 1765, 469, 526, 1921, 1921, 1551, 1010, 526, 1765, 170, 1252, 1551, 170, 1765, 896, 1494, 227, 227, 1765, 1793, 526, 1765, 412, 1921, 526, 284, 1765, 1551, 1921, 1765, 1551, 711, 1765, 526, 1138, 1551, 469, 1195, 227, 526, 1765, 170, 953, 1765, 284, 526, 469, 953, 711, 1921, 170, 1679, 1551, 170, 526, 1765, 170, 1252, 526, 1765, 754, 227, 1010, 1551, 469, 1551, 227, 1765, 1423, 412, 1793, 227, 1494, 42, 1765, 213, 526, 1380, 1765, 754, 711, 42, 1679, 1380, 1195, 170, 1494, 953, 711, 1167]\n","\n","\tExample:  M = 398*242^1991 mod 1993 = 84\n","\n","Decrypted (Decimal): [84, 104, 105, 115, 32, 105, 115, 32, 97, 32, 109, 101, 115, 115, 97, 103, 101, 32, 116, 104, 97, 116, 32, 119, 105, 108, 108, 32, 98, 101, 32, 117, 115, 101, 100, 32, 97, 115, 32, 97, 110, 32, 101, 120, 97, 109, 112, 108, 101, 32, 116, 111, 32, 100, 101, 109, 111, 110, 115, 116, 114, 97, 116, 101, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 69, 108, 103, 97, 109, 97, 108, 32, 80, 117, 98, 108, 105, 99, 32, 75, 101, 121, 32, 69, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 105, 111, 110, 46]\n","Decrypted: This is a message that will be used as an example to demonstrate the Elgamal Public Key Encryption.\n"]}],"source":["print(f\"Encrypted Message Received (C1, C2): {(C1, C2)}\")\n","\n","# Generate reverse shared key\n","sharedKey = C1**alicePrivateKey % PRIME\n","print(f\"\\nRecomputed Shared Key: {sharedKey}\")\n","\n","print(f\"\\nCiphertext: {C2}\")\n","print(f\"Ciphertext (Decimal): {[ord(i) for i in C2]}\")\n","\n","print(f\"\\n\\tExample:  M = {ord(C2[0])}*{sharedKey}^{PRIME-2} mod {PRIME} = {ord(C2[0])*sharedKey**(PRIME-2) % PRIME}\")\n","decrypted = [ord(x)*sharedKey**(PRIME-2) % PRIME for x in C2]\n","\n","print(f\"\\nDecrypted (Decimal): {decrypted}\")\n","print(f\"Decrypted: {''.join([chr(i) for i in decrypted])}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DmKTehCs-H4H"},"source":["# Conclusion\n","---\n","\n","Now you have a better understanding of how key generation, encryption, and decryption work in Elgamal Public Key Cryptography.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yKnw2b9S6a3j"},"source":["# Resources\n","1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption \n","1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elgamal-encryption-algorithm/ \n","1. https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/35a1c2baa00b447f9275e8f71b02ef29#elgamal-signature-scheme \n","1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_signature_scheme\n","1. https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/26ee8f79aaa74d758f3a9429e28c8c6c \n","1. https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=RelativelyPrime#:~:text=Two%20integers%20are%20relatively%20prime,12%20and%2014%20are%20not. \n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.11.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
