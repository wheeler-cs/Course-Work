### Important Update: September 27, 2021
I have decided to archive this repository as it has been nearly a year since this course was taken. Nothing should change within the repository and all code
and projects should be final. However, if in the future something should arise that would necessitate a change to content, the repository would be temporarily
unarchived (dearchived?) while the required fixes were implemented.

# CISP_2410 Assembly Programs
Assembly programs are written in IA-64 assembly using AT&T syntax (GAS assembly syntax).

The .quad (quad word, 8-byte) data type was used exclusively for these programs since this is just an introductory course to assembly concepts.

Programs were compiled, ran, and debugged in [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/), but this could be done in a desktop environment as well with the right
tools (GDB and g++ in a Linux environment).


# CISP_2410 Arduino Programs
Arduino programs are written using C++ with Arduino functions.

The Arduino Uno was used as the development board the were programs ran on. The board diagrams are XML files compatible with TinkerCAD's online workspace.

Programs and circuits were written and designed in [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), but could be adapted to a physical Arduino board and the 
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) quite easily.


Feel free to use these programs as reference or a starting-off point for your own projects.
